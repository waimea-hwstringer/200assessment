# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Cake shop website**

Project Author: **Harry Stringer**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

My sister madison owns a cake business where clients request a certain type of cake and she will make it for them. Her business has grown to the point where keeping track of all of her orders is difficult and the process of ordering cakes needs to be streamlined.

### End-User Requirements

Clients who want a cake to be made for them come from all walks of life. There is no specific age that they would be. Therefore the website must be clear, concise and easy to use.

The level of IT knowledge that users may have will vary greatly. This means that the website must be easy to navigate & use.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.
