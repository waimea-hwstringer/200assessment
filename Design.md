# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Cake shop website**

Project Author: **Harry Stringer**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

My sister Madison owns a cake business where clients request a certain type of cake and she will make it for them. Her business has grown to the point where keeping track of all of her orders is difficult and the process of ordering cakes needs to be streamlined.

### End-User Requirements

Clients who want a cake to be made for them come from all walks of life. There is no specific age that they would be. Therefore the website must be clear, concise and easy to use.

The level of IT knowledge that users may have will vary greatly. This means that the website must be easy to navigate & use.

### Proposed Solution

To help my sister deal with the growing size & capabilities of her cake business, I will produce a website that allows customers to place a custom order for a cake, and allows my sister to view an organised list of the orders that have been placed.

## Relevant Implications

### USABILITY

The usability implication entails how easy it is to use a website.

This implication is relevant to my project because there will be a wide range of different people using my website who will have varying IT skills.

When designing the user interface for my website I will use Nielson's heuristics to ensure that my website is easy and intuitive to use. The UI should be clear and consistent through out the whole site with contrasting colours to make it easy to see. To verify this I will test my website with a range of users and observe how easy it is for them to use.

### FUNCTIONALITY

The functionality implication entails whether the website works as intended or not.

This implication is relevant to my project because having a working website is critcial to the user experience. The website must not have any errors and must be easily navigable for users of all expertise. 

Going forward with this project I will need to ensure that the website is fully functional and does not have any critical errors. It must meet the user requirements. To verify this I will test my website with a range of users and observe how easy it is for them to use.

### AESTHETICS

The aesthetics implication is how the website looks.

Aesthetics is absolutely vital to the user experience. Having a website that looks good will leave a good impression on the user.

I will need to make sure that the aesthetics and feel of the site remain consistent through out the whole site. I will use aspects of colour theory to make sure that my website looks good and follows common colouring conventions.

### END USERS

The end user implication is the specific needs that the users have from the website.

This implication is relevant to my project because the website must appeal to the user's needs in order to be successful. I will have to ensure that I am appealing to the right demographic (that is being people who want cakes made for them).

I will need to make sure that the website fulfills all of the requirements that the user may have. It is important to know your userbase in order to do this. I will test this by gathering feedback from users and asking them if it fulfilled all of their needs.

### SOCIAL 

The social implication is how the website affects the user personally.

This implication is relevant to my project because the website must have a positive social impact on the users. This can be by using friendly language and being inclusive to all users.

I will need to make sure that the website fulfills all of the social needs for a user by using clear language that should not be able to be interpreted as controversial.

-------------------------------------------------

## User Experience

### USEFUL

It is important for users to find the website useful. This is because I am making this website to streamline the process of gathering and organizing orders for my sister's cake company. If the website is not efficient and useful for her to use then she will not use it.

### USABLE

It is important for users to find the website usable. The website must be easy to use because the clientel may have little to no experience using websites. It must be clear, concise and easy to navigate.

### DESIRABLE

It is important for users to find the website desirable. If the website does not look aesthetically and is not nice to use users will not want to use the website again.

### USABLE

It is important for users to find the website usable. The website must be easy to use because the clientel may have little to no experience using websites. It must be clear, concise and easy to navigate.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
