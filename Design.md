# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Cake shop website**

Project Author: **Harry Stringer**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

My sister madison owns a cake business where clients request a certain type of cake and she will make it for them. Her business has grown to the point where keeping track of all of her orders is difficult and the process of ordering cakes needs to be streamlined.

### End-User Requirements

Clients who want a cake to be made for them come from all walks of life. There is no specific age that they would be. Therefore the website must be clear, concise and easy to use.

The level of IT knowledge that users may have will vary greatly. This means that the website must be easy to navigate & use.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

## Relevant Implications

### USABILITY

The usability implication entails how easy it is to use a website.

This implication is relevant to my project because there will be a wide range of different people using my website who will have varying IT skills.

When designing the user interface for my website I will use Nielson's heuristics to ensure that my website is easy and intuitive to use. The UI should be clear and consistent through out the whole site with contrasting colours to make it easy to see. To verify this I will test my website with a range of users and observe how easy it is for them to use.

### FUNCTIONALITY

The functionality implication entails whether the website works as intended or not.

This implication is relevant to my project because having a working website is critcial to the user experience. The website must not have any errors and must be easily navigable for users of all expertise. 

Going forward with this project I will need to ensure that the website is fully functional and does not have any critical errors. It must meet the user requirements. To verify this I will test my website with a range of users and observe how easy it is for them to use.

### AESTHETICS

The aesthetics implication is how the website looks.

Aesthetics is absolutely vital to the user experience. Having a website that looks good will leave a good impression on the user.

I will need to make sure that the aesthetics and feel of the site remain consistent through out the whole site. I will use aspects of colour theory to make sure that my website looks good and follows common colouring conventions.

### END USERS

The end user implication is the specific needs that the users have from the website.

This implication is relevant to my project because the website must appeal to the user's needs in order to be successful. I will have to ensure that I am appealing to the right demographic (that is being people who want cakes made for them).

I will need to make sure that the website fulfills all of the requirements that the user may have. It is important to know your userbase in order to do this. I will test this by gathering feedback from users and asking them if it fulfilled all of their needs.

### SOCIAL 

The social implication is how the website affects the user personally.

This implication is relevant to my project because the website must have a positive social impact on the users. This can be by using friendly language and being inclusive to all users.

I will need to make sure that the website fulfills all of the social needs for a user by being
