# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Cake shop website**

Project Author: **Harry Stringer**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

My sister Madison owns a cake business where clients request a certain type of cake and she will make it for them. Her business has grown to the point where keeping track of all of her orders is difficult and the process of ordering cakes needs to be streamlined.

### End-User Requirements

Clients who want a cake to be made for them come from all walks of life. There is no specific age that they would be. Therefore the website must be clear, concise and easy to use.

The level of IT knowledge that users may have will vary greatly. This means that the website must be easy to navigate & use.

### Proposed Solution

To help my sister deal with the growing size & capabilities of her cake business, I will produce a website that allows customers to place a custom order for a cake, and allows my sister to view a list of the orders that have been placed.

On my website the customers should be able to:
- place an order for a cake
- view past examples of cakes (ordered by theme)

On my website my sister should be able to:
- view a list of orders that have been placed
- edit the example images that are displayed

Additionally the website should be
- easy to use
- enjoyable to use
- aesthetically pleasing

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### USABILITY

The usability implication entails how easy it is to use a website.

This implication is relevant to my project because there will be a wide range of different people using my website who will have varying IT skills.

When designing the user interface for my website I will use Nielson's usability heuristics to ensure that my website is easy and intuitive to use. I will need to keep in mind visibility of system status, one of Nielsons' heuristics. This means alerting the user when something is wrong, such as adding an error screen. Another heuristic I will need to consider is consistency and standards. The UI should be clear and consistent through out the whole site with different colours to make it easy to see. A third heuristic to keep in mind is recognition rather than recall. This essentially means using well known icons & symbols to make using the website easy for the end user. To verify all of this I will test my website with a range of users and observe how easy it is for them to use.

### FUNCTIONALITY

The functionality implication entails whether the website works as intended or not.

This implication is relevant to my project because having a working website is critcial to the user experience. The website must not have any errors and must be easily navigable for users of all expertise. 

Going forward with this project I will need to ensure that the website is fully functional and does not have any critical errors. It must meet the user requirements. To verify this I will test my website with a range of users and observe how easy it is for them to use.

### AESTHETICS

The aesthetics implication is how the website looks.

Aesthetics is absolutely vital to the user experience. Having a website that looks good will leave a good impression on the user.

I will need to make sure that the aesthetics and feel of the site remain consistent through out the whole site. I will use aspects of colour theory to make sure that my website looks good and follows common colouring conventions.

### END USERS

The end user implication is the specific needs that the users have from the website.

This implication is relevant to my project because the website must appeal to the user's needs in order to be successful. I will have to ensure that I am appealing to the right demographic (that is being people who want cakes made for them).

I will need to make sure that the website fulfills all of the requirements that the user may have. It is important to know your userbase in order to do this. I will test this by gathering feedback from users and asking them if it fulfilled all of their needs.

### SOCIAL 

The social implication is how the website affects the user personally.

This implication is relevant to my project because the website must have a positive social impact on the users. This can be by using friendly language and being inclusive to all users.

I will need to make sure that the website fulfills all of the social needs for a user by using clear language that should not be able to be interpreted as controversial.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

I wrote that my end users would be pretty much anybody, and this was correct. Consulting my client, I found that anyone and everyone can order a cake, and they do so for a wide variety of reasons.
I stated that my end users may have little to no tech knowledge, so my website must be easy to use. I accomplished this goal, as my website follows common design principles like Nielson's heuristics. In order to ensure that my website was easy to use, I tested my site with several different people. Of course I gave it to my client (my sister, who is fourteen) and she had no difficulties whatsoever. I also tested it with both of my parents and my grandparents, and none of them had difficulty navigating or using the site either.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.

On my website the customers should be able to:
- place an order for a cake
- view past examples of cakes (ordered by theme)

On my website my sister should be able to:
- view a list of orders that have been placed
- edit the example images that are displayed

Additionally the website should be
- easy to use
- enjoyable to use
- aesthetically pleasing

I wrote at the start that users should be able to order a cake, and view past examples of cakes. Both of these features were implemented and are working as intended. My sister was supposed to be able to view orders that have been placed, and edit the example images on the index page. Again, both of these features are implemented and working. All evidence of this can be found in the Completed System section above. Additionally, I stated that the site should be aesthetically pleasing as well as easy and enjoyable to use. I followed colour theory to ensure that my website was aesthetically pleasing. After my parents and grandparents used the site, I asked them if they thought that the site was easy and enjoyable to use, and all of them said that it was.
