## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 16/05/24

Database structure

Today I made the structure for the database for the website. There will be a database with admin login credentials, a list of themes for the cake that will help them be organized on the site, and the booking details.

Improved database and made a flow chart

Today I added another database that will store exemplar images and descriptions about previous cakes my sister has baked.

Next I made a flowchart to draft how the end users will navigate through the site.

I showed this flowchart to my client (my sister)

>That looks like it will work fine.

### 21/05/2024

Today I made some drafts in Figma. These designs are pretty loose and are not perfectly to scale with any phone screen, so this will need to be changed.

### 23/05/2024

Today I continued to work on the loose diagrams.example pages with figma. This time the screen proportions and resolution are consistent with that of an iPhone 13/14. I will show these to my client on Saturday to see whether or not they are going to work for her, and what I should tweak.

### 25/05/2024

Today I discussed my ideas with my client.

She didn't like the idea of having any pictures of herself in the about page.
> - "[The picture of her] It's shit!"
> - "If someone requests something to extravagant and I don't have the skillset or the timeframe then there must be a way to reject it."
> - "I need to see if there is a time limit."
> - "Needs to specify their address or would need to pay for delivery or come pick it up."
> - "It needs to specify that it's in the Nelson area."

I need to add more in depth size options (i.e. add dimensions of the cake tins) and add a shape option.
There also must be a way to delete themes as well as add them.

The option for the landing page that she preferred the most is Landing Page 4.

### 25/05/2024

Today I implemented the feedback that I got from my client.

- On the about section it will have the location of the business
- About section will not have a picture of her 
- There will be a new column on the bookings db for date and time (The date that the order is due by)
- Added a new column for address
- Options to delete an example or theme
- On the pricing section there will be a delivery fee stated (delivery only available in Nelson region)

Flowchart MK 2. Now with time, date & pickup on bookings.

### 30/05/2024

Today I was working on the wireframe in Figma

![figma3](images/figma3.png)
I edited the landing page to include the example images at the bottom in categorized groups rather than have them be directly under the header. I think that this makes the site more concise and easily navigable. I will need to discuss this change with my client as they stated that they liked the landing page. I also added the edit themes page and edit examples page.

Later, I added colour to the wireframe. The colour palette that I used was automatically generated from Realtime Colors. I am not sure what my client wants colour scheme wise, so this will more than likely completely change in the future.

### 10/06/2024

Today I received & implemented feedback from my client

Over the weekend I showed my client the small changes that I made to the wireframe and the colours that I implemented. I showed her using the figma app on my phone. She gave me some constructive feedback about my design.

She liked the change I made to the landing page, but not the colours.
>"The first page actually looks better now with the pictures at the bottom. I don't really like the colours that you have chosen though. I'd rather the main theme be a cyan/blue colour rather than pink, and the website needs to be more neutral. I think that the pink everywhere makes it looks too childish rather than an actual business. There is too much colour everywhere."

After hearing her criticisms, I made these changes to the design.

I Changed the colours to be more neutral & blue as she requested
