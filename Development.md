## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 16/05/24

Database structure

Today I made the structure for the database for the website. There will be a database with admin login credentials, a list of themes for the cake that will help them be organized on the site, and the booking details.

Improved database and made a flow chart

Today I added another database that will store exemplar images and descriptions about previous cakes my sister has baked.

Next I made a flowchart to draft how the end users will navigate through the site.

I showed this flowchart to my client (my sister)

>That looks like it will work fine.

### 21/05/2024

Today I made some drafts in Figma. These designs are pretty loose and are not perfectly to scale with any phone screen, so this will need to be changed.

### 23/05/2024

Today I continued to work on the loose diagrams.example pages with figma. This time the screen proportions and resolution are consistent with that of an iPhone 13/14. I will show these to my client on Saturday to see whether or not they are going to work for her, and what I should tweak.
